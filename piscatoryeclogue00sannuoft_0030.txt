24 INTRODUCTION

Ι 3111 flatter'd to believe my Endeavours would meet with 3 more
favourable Acceptance‚ if Sannazarius had never wrote his Sea-
Eclogues; the Exercise of Fislzing appears so contemptible 111 him,
that any one who writes on the same Subject afterwards will prob-
ably be accounted, is not a dull Imitator‚ yet a very barren Original.
His Oysters and Crayfish are serv⁷d perpetually over, without any
Change between. and you may crack your Teeth before you get at his
Entertainment. His H'ater-chrins differ in no respect from our
simple ones on Land, only that he turns thern to Sea in an old tat-
ter’d Boat, and so leaves them to seek their Fortunes. Rocks, Waves
and desert Shores are their insensible Retinue. How unlike the At-
tendants upon Milton’s pastoral Pipe!

Rouglz Satyrs danced and Fauns with cloven Heel
From the glad Sound would not be absent long,
And old Damaetas lov’d to hear our Song.

On July 21, 1750, Dr. Samuel Johnson published 311
essay in lee Rambler, which settled the whole question
of the piscatory eclogue for that generationj

The conviction of the necessity of some new source of pleasure
induced Sannazarius to remove the scene from the fields to the sea,
to substitute fishermen for shepherds‚ and derive his sentiments from
the piscatory life, for which he has been censured by succeediJig
critics‚ because the sea is an object of terror, and by no means proper
to amuse the mind and lay the passions asleep. Against this objec-
tion he might be defended by the established maxim. that the poet
has a right to select his imageS, and is no more obliged to show the
sea in a storm, than the land under an inundation; but may display
all the pleasures. and conceal the dangers of the water, as he may
lay his shepherd under a shady beech. without giving him an ague,
or letting a wild beast 10056 upon him.

There are, however, two defects in the piscatory eclogue‚ ¹which
perhaps cannot be supplied. The sea, though in hot countries it is
considered by those who live,'like Sanmzzarius, upon the coast, as 3
111366 of pleasure and diversion. 1135, notwithstanding, much less
variety than the land, and therefore will be sooner exhausted by a
descriptive writer. When he has once shown the sun rising or setting
upon it, curled its waters with the vernal breeze, rolled the waves in
gentle succession to the shore, and enumerated the fish sporting in
the shallows. he has nothing remaining but what is common to all
other poetry, the complaint of a nymph for a drowned lover, or the
indignation of a fisher that his oysters are refused, and Mycon’s ac—
cepted.

Another obstacle to the general reception of this kind of poetry, is
the ignorance of maritime pleasures, in which the greater part of
mankind must always live. To all the inland inhabitants of every
region, the sea is only known as an immense diffusion of waters,
over which men pass from one country to another, and in which life
