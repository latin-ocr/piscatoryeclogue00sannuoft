is frequently lost. They have. therefore. no opportunity os tracing
in their own thoughts the descriptions os winding shores and calm
bays. nor can look on the poem in which they are mentioned with
other sensation than on a sea chart. or the metrieal geography ot‘
Dionysius.

This desect Sannazarius was hindered from pereeiving, by writing
in a learned language to readers generally acquainted with the
works os nature; but is he had made his attempt in any vulgar
tongue, he would soon have discovered how vainly he had endeav-
oured to make that loved, which was not understood.

All this-is very impressive. and very final; but it really
has very little to do with what Sannazaro actually wrote.
For in these piscatory eclogues there is no more about the
sunrise at sea, or the fish sporting in the shallows, or the
complaint of a nymph for a drowned lover, than there is in
Virgil himself. .

In 1783 an Edinburgh scholar, Hugh Blair, had some-

thing to say of Sannazaro, Lectnres on Rhetoric- and Belles

The modern writers of pastorals have, generally, contented them-

relished by men, than sishes and marine productions.

Apparently Blair was much more familiar with the opin-
ions of Johnson and Fontenelle than with the Latin original.
Stin, his Lea-tures were used as a text-book far into the
next century, and probably very few of his readers ever
questioned his authority, or read the poems for themselves,

Another bit of traditional criticisrn which is often quoted
comes from William Roscoe's Life and Pontificate of Lea
tlze Tentlz (1805). He is speaking of Sannazaro’s Latin
poems:

Of these the eclogues possess the merit of having exhibited a novel
species of composition, in adapting the language of poetry to the
characters and occupations of fishermen; and this task he has exe-
