IMITA TIONS 53

Since he is gone. l'll setch him to my Arms

By sacred Spells. and soree of Magick Charms.
Search in the Slime‚ you’ll sind the Cranip-fish there,
That chilling stops whatever swims too near:

You'll find the Fish that stays the labouring Ship,
'rho‘ russling &Vinds drive o'er the noisy Deep:

So Phorbas, while from me he perjur’d flies.

Is struck benumb‘d, and fix'd with strange ⁸&urprise

with Ecl. v. 55-58. The twelfth poem reports a dialogue
between two fishermen, and the last two (xiii, xiv) contain
some curiods information about fishes.

The Piscatory Eclogues of Moses Browne were first pub-
lished (London, 1729) with the sub-title “an Essay to
introduce new Rules and new Characters into Pastoral''.
They are not a mere paraphrase or a slavish imitation of
Sannazaro's poems3 indeed, their author was “flatter3d to
believe his Endeavours would meet with a more favourable
Acceptance, if Sanazarius had never wrote his Sea-
Eclogues '’. Stin, the second, lee Nocturnal, may remind
the reader of Sannazaro’s second 3 and ‘Renock’ is a sort
of eighteenth-century ‘ Lycon ’:

Coy Maid! lost lovely Sweet! ah, you can rest,
While Ι still wake with eruel Cares opprest‚
Blest Pow'r of Sleep! her Eye-lids gently close,
Melt her soft Dreams with Renock's dying Woes!

The scene of the third, The Sea Swains, may recall San‘
nazaro’s third. “A Company of Fishers, forc'd in their
Boats from Sea, by bad Weatloer, take Harbour up a shady
Stream‚ where they divert and refresh themselves ”. The
poem begins:

By a close Greek, with shelt'ring Rocks confin’d,
While the Seas echo’d to the vexing wind,

Old Chromis in his dancing Boat withdrew‚

To mix in Pastimes with the Izarbonr'd Crew.

Here while their Oars the idle Nets sustain

(Drove from their Labours on the madding Μαίη)
The Fisher-Sire, in Skill experienc’d long,

The Youtlzs now challenge for his promis¹d Song.⁰1
