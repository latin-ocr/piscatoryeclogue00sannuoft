‘⁴ Thelgon. a poorc fisher-swain⁷‘ (the name from Sann.
Ecl. v) sits under a ⁴‘ rocky canopic '' and there sings ‘⁴ to
seas and rocks '’. Cp. Sann. [vicl. ii⁴ l, ‘forte Lycon vacuo
fessus consederat antro Ι piscator.‘ etc. His phrase ‘withy
labyrinths’‚ st. 5, comes from Ecl. iii. 12, and the lines,
st. 6: ’

There while our thinne nets dangling in the winde
Hung on our oars tops,

from Ecl, =iii. 10. The opening stanza of the second
eclogue, Tln'rsil :

Myrtil. why idle sit we on the shore?

Since stormy windes and waves intestine spite
Impatient rage of sail or bending oare:

Sit we and sing, while windes and waters fight;
And carol lowd os love. and loves ‹lt—light,

should be compared with Ecl. iii. l-lO. And so should
the opening stanza of the third, lllyrlilus:

His dangling nets (hung on the trembling oare)
Had leave to play, so had his idle hook,
While madding windes the madder Ocean shook.

In' the same third eclogue, stanza 17:

See, see, fair Caelia, sens are calmly laid,

And end their boisterous threats in quiet peace;

The waves their ‹lrummes. the wimles their trumpets cease:
But my siek love (ah love full ill anayd 1)

Never can hope his storms may be allayd; etc.‚

may be compared with Ecl. ii. 11-16. In the seventh
eclogue‚ lee Prize, the second stanza:

Stella, whose love his life, and whose disdain
Seems worse then angry skies‚ or never quiet main,

reminds one of Ecl. iii. 59-61 ; the thirteenth:

Proteus, thy song to heare,
Seas list’ning stand, and windes to whistle sear:
The lively Delphins danee, and brisly Seales give ειη-ς,
