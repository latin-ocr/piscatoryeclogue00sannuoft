lium? In Ampelio-is nullus (quod seiani)''. Some 01 111050
poenis were written in France, between 1617 and 1620.

In the third part 01 Β1111011’5 Anatolny os Melanclzoly (ed.
Shilleto, iii. 155) there 15 a rather confusing reference to
Sannazaro: “Accius Sannazarizts Ecloga 2¹. de Galatea, in
the same manner seigns his Lycoris tormenting herself for
want of sleep, sighing, sobbing, and lamenting '’. The
lamenting in 11115 Second Eclogue is done, not by ‘ Lycoris ’,
but by the fishernian ‘Lycon’. And the quotation in
Burton's sootnote does not come from Sannazaro at all.

()n April 13, 1713, the Guardian printed a criticism of
Sannazaro which indicates that the popularity of 1115 Pisca-
tory Eclogues in England was then very slight:

When Ι arn speaking of the ltalians, it would be unpardonable to
pass by Sannazarius. He hath changed the scene in this kind of
poetry from woods and lawns. to the barren beach and boundless
ocean; introduces sea-calves in the room 01 kids and lambs, sea-
mews 101 the lark and the linnet, and presents his mistress with
oysters instead 01 1111115 and flowers. How good soever his style and
thoughts may be. yet who can pardon him for 1115 arbitrary change
of the sweet manners and pleasing objects 01 1110 country, for what
in their own nature are uncomfortable and dreadful? Ι think he
hath few or no followers‚ or, if any, such as knew little of his
beauties, and only copied his faults. and so are lost and forgotten.

And the sanie thing 15 indicated by a second essay, printed
four days later—a pleasant fable 01 1110 Wooing of
Amaryllis:

While they were in the midst os their joy, they were surprised with
a very odd appearance. A person in a blue mantle. crowned with
sedges and rushes, stepped into the middle of 1110 ring. IIe had an
angling rod in his hand, a pannier upon his back, and a poor meagre
wretch in wet clothes carried some oysters before him. Being asked
whence he came, and what he was? he told them, 110 was corne to in-
vite Amaryllis from the plains 1071110 sea-shore. that his substance
consisted in sea-calves. and that he was aequainted with the Nereids
and the Naiads. ‘ Art thou acquainted with the Naiads?’ said
Menalcas: ‘to them then shalt thou return '. The shepherd imme-
diately hoisted him up as an enemy to Arcadia, and plunged him in
the river. where he snnk. and was never heard of since.

Thirtcen years later this criticism called forth a spirited
reply, in the Preface 01 John Rooke's Selcct Translations
