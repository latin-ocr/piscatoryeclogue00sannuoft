12 INTRODUCTJON

thrown (1501) he went into voluntary exile with his sover-
eign and remained in France until after Federico's death
(Sept. 9, 1504). Returning to Naples‚ he lived in the
villa which Federico had given him, and, Pontano being
now dead, his house became the chief meeting-place of the
Academy. He died April 24, 1530. He was buried in the
little church of S. Maria del Parto Which he had erected in
his villa. And Pietro Bembo wrote his epitaph:

His Academic name was ‘Actius Syncerus ’. The mean-
ing of this name is obscure, but it is certain that he received
it, or assumed it, quite early in his literary career—as early,
at least, 35 1481.3 Ρ3111115 Jovius says that he took it at the
suggestion of Pontano: “cum praeclarum fecundi atque
felicis ingenii specimen daret, repudiato avito gentilitioque
nomine, Actius Syncerus appellari voluit, adhortante Pon-
tano. qui Ioviani cognomen amicor'um imitatione desum-

Gio. Battista Crispo, G. Ant. Volpi and F rancesco Colangelo.

All three of these Vitae add that he was named ‘Syncerus'
because of his personal character and the character of his
writings. Crispo says: “et allo stile et alla dolce et leal
sua natura parimente hauendo riguardo ”.5 Volpi has:
“ quod sine fuco et fallaciis vitam ageret ''.⁶ And Colangelo
says: “in perpetuo monumento della maravigliosa ingenuita

³· In the dedication of Pontano’s De Liberalitate he is addressed as
‘Sincere Acti ’‚ and in this treatise Mahommed II is mentioned as
still alive: “ Mahometum qui nunc Turcis ac Graecis imperat '' (G.
Rosalba, Le Egloglte Pescatorie di J. hummaro, Napoli‚ 1908, p. 41).
In the Arcadia, a work composed ‘⁶ nela prima adolescentia del
poeta '', he refers to himself as ⁴ Sincero '. And in two of his earlier
poemS, Eleg. 1, 10, 23, and 11, 7, 71, he calls himself ‘ Actius '.
