speak of “the admirable Latin Piscatories of that nohlt¹
Neapolitan Sanazaro''. In the dedication os his Sylva
poetica Phineas Fletcher has an allusion to the Piscatory
Eclogues:

Quin fixos super appendens modo retia remos
Italicus scopulos inter Piscator et undas
l‘arthenopae canit et piscosae Mergilinae.

And he has another in The Purple Islaml. i. 13:

And now os late th’ Italian fisher-swain
Sits on the shore to wateh his trembling line:
There teaches rocks and prouder seas to plain
By Nesis fair and fairer Mergiline:
While his thinne net, upon his oars twin’d. etc. ,

Compare, especially, Ecl. iii. 10:

raraque per longos pendebant retia remos.

In the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the Eclogues of
Joannes Leochaeus Scotus‚³⁸ Sannazaro is still regarded as
a pioneer—though Leochaeus himself knew‚ and imitated,
the twenty-first Idyl of Theocritus.³⁹ This Scottish poet
has twenty eclogues, divided into four groups (‘ bucolicae ',
‘ piscatoriae ⁹, ¹ nauticae ’‚ and ‘ ampelicae ’ sive ‘vinitoriae ’)‚
and he claims some credit for their variety: “ namque, ut
Bucolica excipias, in quibus non pauci: ,quis oro praeter
Sanazarz‘um Piscatorias Eclogas: quis praeter Hzcgoncm
Grotium Nauticas tentavit? ⁴⁰ et illius (quod dolori maximo

4⁰ Piscatory eclogues had been written by Berardino Rota, Ber-
nardo Tasso, Bernardino Baldi, Camoens, Belleau‚ and others. In his
Myrtilus, sive Idyllium Nauticum, Grotius professed to be playing
the part of a pioneer: “Prima mihi, sylvis et amoeno fonte relicto, Ι
fistula ad Oceani fluctus et ad aequora venit''; but nautical eclogues
had already been written by Lorenzo Gambara,⁴ Grotius' poem is an ⁸⁸⁴ ‘7
imitation of Theocritus (111, 6-7‚ 21-27‚ 37-39; xx, 19·32; xxr, 8-12). fua-ane„
