PREFACE

ΤΗΕ favorable reception accorded to my edition of “ good
old Mantuan ‘’ has encouraged me to make a similar study
of the much better eclogues of Sannazaro.

The tex-fis based upon that of the first printed edition,
of Naples, 1526. The more important later variants are
mentioned in the notes. The spelling is modified to suit the
convenience of the modern reader. The punctuation is
my own. .

Through the good offices of J. A. HERBERT, Esq.‚ of the
British Museum, Ι had secured a ‘rotograph' copy of the
Editio Princeps. And through a similar courtesy on the
part of Abbe PAUL LIEBAERT, I am able to print Sannazaro's
piscatory fragment as it stands in the Vatican ‘autograph ’.
’ Ι hope that most of my obligations to earlier writers are
duly acknowledged in the footnotes. But there is one ex-
cellent book which seems to have been left for special men-
tion here: La Poesia Pastorale‚ by ENR1co CARRARA‚ Milan,
1909.
