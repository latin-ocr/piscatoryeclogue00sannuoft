syom the Works of Sannazarius, ll. Grotius, Bczpt. Α mal-
t 1cus, cta:

1 am not insensible that a late celebrated Author, in some of his
Criticisms, has found Fault with Sannazarius for ehoosing the Sea
for the Scene of his Eclogues, and sor introducing ffishermen and
their Nem, instead of Shepherds and their l·‘locks; But he might
have considered, that these Poenis weredcsigned chiefly to honour
his Native Country, which, being a Maritima: l'laee, could not, eonse-
quently, be a proper Scene for l'astorals: Resides, ’tis certain, that a
Plan may be contriv⁷d, and a l'oem written upon any os the Orna-
mental Part„- bf Nature; and if the lncidents he justly laid, the De-
scriptions compleat, and the Characters truly drawn, the l'oem must
be perfect.

Now as the Hills and Vales, the woods and Lamus, are the Scenes
of a l‘astoral l'oem, so the Sea and the Sea-shores are the Scenes of
these Eclogues; which, in their very Nature, differ as widely from
Pastorals, as the Two Elements from each other. ,

’Tis,1rue, the Earth, array’d in all her vernal (ilory‚ assords a
more agreeable Prospect; it charms the liye with a greater Diver-
sity of Objeets, and, consequently‚ gives an Opportunity for a Poet
to entertain his Readers with a more pleasing Variety of Images;
But still the Sea, and the adjacent Shores, may yield Matter suffi-
cient, tho' not altogether so copiouS, for a &Vork os a different Kind;
and Whales, Delphins, Tritons‚ and syrens may be introduced there
to as good purpose, as (loats on the Mountains‚ or Oxen in the Vales.
Shells and Corals and Oysters are as proper for a Fisherman to pre—
sent to his Mistress, as Cups and Flutes and Sheep-crooks are for a
Shepherd‚ and Proteus, and Glaucus, certainly. are as much Sover-
eigns of the Sea, as Pan, and sylvanus of the Land.

A Sea-Skip‚ therefore, well describ'd, is far from striking us with
that Horrour, which this Author would insinuate, . . .

Here, 1 will take Leave of this Gentleman, who seems to have
used a Freedom with Sannazarius‚ that, to say no worse of it. tres—
passes both upon Decency and good manners.

ln 1729 there appeared a further proof that Sannazaro
had not been wholly forgotten. In that year Moses Browne
published his Piscatory liclagues: ‘An Essay to Introduce
new Rules and new Charaeters into Pastoral. 'l‘o which is
prefixed a Discussion in Defence of this Undertaking’.
The book was puhlished anonymously, and the dedication
signed ‘Immerito '. The ‘defence' is a defenee of
Browne’s own eclogues„ not of Sannazaro’s. Ι quote a part
of it from the ‘second edition, corrected and enlarged'
which he printed in his Pm’ms on V arious Suhjects, Lon-
don, 1739. This shows one or two verhal changes from
the first edition.
