52 INTRODUCTION

In his second ⁴ ecloga nautica ', the words of ‘Aegialeus 'z

quem mihi Donensis eustos dedit aequoris olim,
dum canerem. dixitque ‘tuae haec sint praemia Musae,
quandoquidem nostra cecinit non talis in acta',

are an echo of ΕΛ. 11. 41-45. And the mention of “ditis
proles Polyl›otae’' is due to Ecl. ii. 18. 111 the third,
Pluvura, two of the songs:

Creta Iovi magno, sua Mercurio Cyllene,
Vulcano Lemnos, Veneri gratissima Cyprus,
Litha meae Panopae; si Lithae commoda norint,
Vulcanus Lemnon, linquet Venus aurea Cyprum,

and

Bacchus amat Thebas, doctas Tritonia Athenas,
Mars Rhodopen iactat. proles Latonia De10n;
Edini turres dum mellea Chloris amabit.

nec Rhodope Edinuni vincet. nec candida Delos.

are copied from Sannazaro. Ecl. iii. 70-77. In the fifth,
Eclw, the passage:

Vitatur Boreas. Auster vitatur et Eurus,

vitatur nix cana, imbres, gelidaeque pruinae,
onmia vitantur; sed amorem et spicula mortis
non modus effugere est, nec ab his fas currere,

is an imitation of Ecl. ii. 71-72.

In the tenth eclogue of W. Diaper’s Nereides a rner-
maid (ι Meroe’) tries to call back her faithless lover by
enchantments: and some of the charms 5116 uses are bor-
rowed from Sannazaro’s ‘Herpylis'. Compare, for ex-
ample, the lines:

“¹0 Nereides.- ον Sea-Eclogues, London, 1712. The book was pub-
lished anonymously, and the author's name 15 often misspelled. He
is mentioned in Swift's Journal lo Stella, XLIII, 12: “Here is a
young sellow has writ some Sea Eclogues‚ Poems of Mermen, re-
sembling pastorals and shepherds. and they are very pretty, and the
thought 15 new. . . . His name 15 Diaper’'. A copy in the Colum-
bia University Library bears an inscription by “The Author. W. D.,
March 12. 1712 ”. For some account of these poemS‚ see H. M. Hall.
