INTRODUCTION

THE PISCATORY ECLOGUE

IN the long history of the pastoral eclogue it was almost
necessary that some of its conventions should be modified at
times, and one of the most interesting variations was worked
out at the beginning of the sixteenth century by Jacopo
Sannazaro. His Latin Eclogues follow the regular Vir-
gilian forms very closely, and their subjects are the regular
traditional subjects—the dirge, the lover’s complaint, the
singing-mateh‚ etc— But the Virgilian conventions are so
far modified that the pastoral eclogue becomes a piscatory
eclogue, or an idyl of fishermen. The singers are no longer
shepherds, but fishermen, and the scene is no longer Sicily
or Arcadia, but the Bay of NapleS. The wood-nymphs are
transformed into sea-nymphs, the rustic gods into gods os
the sea. Instead os flocks and herds, the speakers talk of
boats and fishing-nets and lobster—pots, and instead of flowers
and fruits the lover’s gifts are oysters and shells and pearls
and coral.
