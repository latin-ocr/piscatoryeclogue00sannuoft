FRAG M 1·: NT U M.

The text of this fragment is taken from the ‘autograph’ in the
Vatican Library (Cod. Lat. 3301). lt was not printed with the
other eclogues in the Naples edition os 1520, or in thc l'aris edition
os 1327; but it must have been circulated soon asterw1r‹ls·‚s0r it is
imitated in lierardino lxota's fourteenth eclogue. A [t is printed in(§⁸..'„;
the Aldine edition os 1535; but this shows a good many varimt read-
ings and the poem is not divided. as here, between two singers.
Rotas imitation suggests that he had the poem in much the same
form as the Aldine edition gives it.

The same Vatican MS (fol. 20V) has what looks like an early
drast os the introduction in Sann azaro s own hand:

Optatos iam Euplea mihi circumspice saleis
Quo liceat trepidas piscanti includere praedas
Ac Zephyris releuare graues spirantibus aestus
Si te certa mouet velocis gratia cymbae
Tuque ades o nostri merces non parua laboris
Quam Phoebus mihi, quam doctae mea turba puellae
Conciliant. dumque ipse hamos ac retia pando
Da vela insinuans, pelagoque excurre patenti
Pars animae Puderice meae, te nam sua Nereus
Per vada. te medio Doris vocat aemula ponto
Qua late horrisonum campus strepit omnis aquarum

ln line 6 the name Triton i< marked out, and Phoebus written above
it. So dadae (b) has been substituted for virides. as (7) for el, and
vocal (10) sor canit. ln line 11 ‹·ampus was written as the second
word, then marked out and transferred to the fourth place.

In the Aldine edition. the second line of the Vatican fragment
does not appear at all; line 26 is completed. by the words et tempora
quattuor anni,· lines 37-42 are inserted after line 24; lines 40-41 read:
horrida Caele l ul sallem miseros lacerarem! ch’nlibus artus. The
Vatican MS. has an extra line (42), but it is hopelessly blm-red.
