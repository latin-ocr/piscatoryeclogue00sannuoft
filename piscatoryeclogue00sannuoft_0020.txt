‘⁴ SALSAS DESCENDI EGO PRIMUS AD UNDAS '’

In his Piscatory Eclogues Sannazaro professed to be
playing the part of a pionecr.¹3 Thus at iv. 17 he writes:

nunc litoream ne despice Musam
quam tibi post silv as, post horrida lustra Lycaei
(si quid id est) salsas deduxi primus ad undas, 0,]- T„ 3 7· ,ἑ-
ausus inexperta tentare pericula cymba. ' '

And in Eleg. iii. 2, 57-58 he has:

quandoquidem salsas descendi ego primus ad undas,
ausus inexpertis reddere verba sonis.

This c1aim ignores certain of the Idyls of Theocritus ¹(vi.
xi, xxi) an author whom Sannazaro knew very well. But it

was allowed by his contemporaries, for example by Lodovico
Ariosto. 0. F. xlvi. 17:

Iacobo Sanazar, ch' alle Camene
Lasciar fa i monti et abitar l'arene;

and Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus, Epistola ad Antonium
T lzebaldeum :

et Syncerus abest, cecinit qui primus in aeta
non prius auditum carmen, quo gurgite ab alto
prosiluit Triton simul et chorus Amphitrites.14

And it has regularly been admitted by his later readers.

DATE OF THE LATIN ECLOGUES

They were first printed at Naples in 1526. Paulus Jovius
speaks of them as youthful compositions: “ illae quae iuveni
exciderant Piscatoriae Eclogaef'fi And Paulus Manutius
states that Sannazaro wrote these and five others like them

13 In his De Parlu Virginis. 111, 193. he says of one of the shep—
herds who came to worship the infant Saviour, “aequoreas carmen
deflexit ad undas ⁹³.
